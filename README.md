# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and the Tkinter library. It features a classic 3x3 grid where two players alternate turns as "X" and "O", complete with automatic win detection that highlights the winning combination in green and announces the victor via a popup message.
